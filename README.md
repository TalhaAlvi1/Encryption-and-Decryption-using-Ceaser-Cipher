# **Encryption and Decryption using Caesar Cipher**

This is a simple Java program that implements the Caesar Cipher technique to encrypt and decrypt messages. Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

# **Features****

**Encryption:** Encrypts a message by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions.

**Decryption:** Decrypts a message by shifting each letter back to its original position.

# **How to Use**

**Run the Program:**

Open the program in your favorite Java IDE or use the command line.
Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Specify the shift value.
**Example:**

Plaintext: HELLO

Shift: 3

Encrypted Text: KHOOR

# **Technologies Used**
